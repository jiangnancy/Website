	<h1> About Me </h1>

	<p> I'm a graduate student at the Craig Newmark School of Journalism based in New York. I was most recently a staff writer at Forbes Advisor, covering personal finance, and have previously covered entertainment and music. You can find my writing in Forbes, NYCity News Service, The US Sun, Boston University's The Daily Free Press, and BU Today. </p>

	<p> I graduated from Boston University in 2022 with a B.S. in Journalism and minor in Political Science. While at BU, I was the community editor of The Daily Free Press and wrote for various music outlets, including HotNewHipHop, as well as started a music column for the school. </p>
